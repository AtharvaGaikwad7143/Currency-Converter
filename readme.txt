🚀 Getting StartedGetting this converter running is straightforward:Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/currency-converter.git
Navigate into the Project Folder:Bashcd currency-converter
Run the Project:Simply open index.html in your web browser. No server or special setup is required!💡 How It WorksThe magic happens primarily within app.js by orchestrating the following steps:Currency List & Dropdown Population:The codes.js file holds all supported currency codes.app.js loops through this data to dynamically populate both "From" and "To" currency dropdowns on page load. (Default selections are USD $\rightarrow$ INR).Flag Update System:Each currency is mapped to its ISO country code in codes.js.When a currency is selected, JavaScript uses this country code to generate a flag image URL (via FlagsAPI) and instantly update the image next to the dropdown.Fetching Live Exchange Rates:The conversion rate is fetched from the Fawaz Ahmed Currency API.app.js constructs the API URL dynamically based on the user's "From" and "To" currency selections (e.g., .../usd/inr.json).The JSON data returned contains the current conversion rate, which is then used to calculate and display the final converted amount in the message section (.msg).Input Validation:To prevent errors, the input amount is validated. If the user leaves the input empty or enters an invalid value, the amount automatically defaults to 1 before conversion.🤝 ContributingContributions are greatly appreciated!
